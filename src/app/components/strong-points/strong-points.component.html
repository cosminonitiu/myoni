          <h1>Perseverance</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-text body-text">
          <p>I was often told that i'm a hard-headed person when it comes to my objectives. Take for example this passsion of mine, called programming. I knew nothing about it not too long ago. But what do we call a sleepless, focused, machine-like man? Crazy... ah? Perseverent, that is the word!</p>

        <div class="feature-text body-text">
          <p>Upgrades, people, upgrades. You need them, i need them. In this ever-evolving world, you either upgrade your 'parts' or take the old-fashioned route. Luckily, today's world offers quite the spare shop, and I got the keys.</p>

          <h1>Tolerance</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-text body-text">
          <p>This strength came from my trading experience. The conclusion i came upon was that every business-related decision should come from a rational plane. It's just my belief, but, if you do manage to not get emotional over money, you're in a right state of mind for evolving.</p>

        <div class="feature-text body-text">
          <p>This one, the mother of all necessities in a team. Acceptance, Teamwork, Learning, all of them stem from this one thing. So what can i say about me? Well, i'll put a question forward. Would i be doing all this if I had my mind stuck in the usual loop?</p>

        <div class="feature-text body-text">
          <p>This one hits close to home for me. I think that as long as you value your time wisely, you are entitled to spend money to save time, as long as you create more value out of it.</p>
