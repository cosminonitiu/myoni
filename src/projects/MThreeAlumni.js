    <p>
      The program was made to get new employees ready, on the technical side for their positions. The goal was to get us started with Linux, C++ and Financial knowledge within 5 weeks. I will detail a bit the topics covered week by week.
    </p>
    <br />
    <strong>Week 1: Linux basics</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>For this experience to be more hands-on, we used the Amazon Server Service</li>
      <li> We gradually started Linux, from the Basic commands, Files, Variables, Reading Files</li>
      <li>We also went into Server Health, Disk Management, Processes, Scripting tools and a bit of Cron</li>
      <li>This week also included a bit of IT history, which was interesting</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <strong>Week 2-4: C++</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>This part of the course was more self-paced, having a considerable amount of information to go through for the basics of C++</li>
      <li>We were assisted by the instructor at all points, having regular meetings and getting new challenges</li>

      <li>We held some coding challenges, one especially fun example being the Code Wars between the group members</li>
      <li>Me and a friend from the group started a home-gym program for the group, for our better health</li>
